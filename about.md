This is a blog for overwhelmed moms.


Moms who feel like they have made mistakes.


Moms who feel like they don’t know what they’re doing.


Moms who think they have failed their kids.


> This blog is a place for you to find rest, comfort, and solidarity. A place where you can get in touch with God, yourself, and your own wonderful, flawed humanity - as a mom and as a person.


## You’re Not Alone


Maybe you’re a mom who assumed that parenting was going to come easily or naturally to you, but now you feel unprepared - all the time.


Maybe you read every book you could get your hands on, or maybe you decided to just wing it - and now you wish you had done it the other way around.


Maybe you find yourself feeling frustrated, angry, incompetent, and like you’re always training on the job.


Do you feel like maybe you’re just not cut out for this?  Do you worry that you have made so many mistakes that you have permanently messed your kids up?  Do you feel the physical, social, spiritual, emotional, and mental pressure of their well-being weighing on you?  Do you worry that you have failed as a parent?


If so, this blog is a place for you to find rest, comfort, and solidarity.  A place where you can get in touch with God, yourself, and your own wonderful, flawed humanity - as a mom and as a person.


## Tied up in Nots


**I’m not** here to give you tips and tricks - the internet is full of that - from people who have way more experience with kids than I do.


**I’m not** here to give you life hacks, schedules, meal plans, or activity ideas - the internet is full of that - from people who are amazingly creative.


**I’m not** here to teach you about child or parent psychology - the internet is full of great content from highly qualified experts.


## Comfort on this Journey


I am a mom who often feels overwhelmed, incompetent, and stressed - so instead of advice, lessons, or instruction, I write devotions, prayers, and meditations - mostly on Bible passages, sometimes other works - that I hope will bring you comfort on your parenting journey.


I’m here to offer you a soft place to land.  A place to be reassured - you are not alone.  A place where I welcome all of your feelings of failure, inadequacy, guilt, resentment, and regret.  Where I tell you that ALL of that is a part of motherhood.  Here there is no pressure, there is only space to recognize and validate whatever feelings you have.  To reassure you that it’s okay and you’re going to be okay, and your kids are going to be okay.  To do what you can and leave the rest in God’s hands.


I’m here to tell you exactly what it says at the top of the page, over and over again, in different ways -
**even on your worst days, you aren’t a bad mom, you haven’t ruined your kid, and God still loves you.**


## God's Message for us


The crux of the Christian message, for me, can be found in Romans 8:38-39 which tells us that nothing separates us from the love of God.  Read about it here ([Nothing Can Separate Us][romans8-38]).

## About me


I am a stay-at-home mom of three (5, 3, and an infant).  I am a military spouse (Space Force), married to my high school sweetheart.  I have a B.A. in History from SFSU, and an M.A. in American History from UNK, and I love to bake, read, hike, and garden.  I have had a variety of jobs (among others: zipline guide, museum curator, pastor, and nonprofit healthcare worker), so creating and growing this blog is yet another new adventure that life has afforded me.  I was raised in the Disciples of Christ Church and write from a progressive Christian perspective.  For a more in-depth look about why I’m writing this blog, click [here][whythisblog].


## A couple of important notes


### My Kids


  While I write about my motherhood, I do not write about my children.  Obviously they exist and I parent them - and those experiences give me things to write about.  However, this blog is about me and my experience, not them and their experiences.  I will not share their faces, names, daily lives, or anything else that makes up their story or identity, except in the most broad terms. Their individual lives and experiences are not the primary content here, my experience mothering them is.  Some things will naturally fall into a gray area, but please know that anything I share about them I have done with utmost consideration to their physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual safety.  I recognize that other moms make different choices.  After a lot of time, prayer, and consideration, I’ve decided these are the boundaries with which I am comfortable.  


### All Parents


  Most of what I write is from my own perspective - a mixed race but white-passing, married, middle class, cisgender, heterosexual woman, who is the biological parent of her children.  In my writing I wrestle with thoughts and ideas about motherhood within our society’s framework of expectations for women and mothers.  We all exist within that framework, yet that set of expectations is almost always exclusive of mothers and parents who fall outside a narrow set of parameters.  So this blog is by an often-overwhelmed mom and will probably speak primarily to other overwhelmed moms, but all parents, children, and family experiences are welcome here.  ALL parents, children and family structures are good, worthy, valid, and BELOVED in the eyes of God.  God’s love is for everyone, and God celebrates and cherishes all the things (gender, sexual orientation, gender expression, family composition, socioeconomic status, education, background, etc.) that make up your identity and experience.


### Finding Further Help


  I often write about feelings of guilt, parenting mistakes, and feeling like we’ve “messed up our kids.”  While I recognize that parenting and relationship choices vary widely, some choices are abuse.  If you and/or your children are being abused, or you are afraid you are an abuser, please call the National Domestic Violence hotline at 800-799-7233, or text START to 88788.  These are 24/7 hotlines where you can discuss your situation and get help.  No one deserves abuse.  If you are trying to break generational cycles of abuse, know that nothing changes if nothing changes, and the best thing you can do is reach out for help.
